How to submit changes to the Antennavis source code.

This software is released under the GNU General Public License (see COPYING), 
and is maintained by Kenneth E. Harker KM5FA (kharker@cs.utexas.edu).

Please try to follow the guidelines below.  This will make things
easier on the maintainer.  Not all of these guidelines matter for every
trivial patch so apply some common sense.

1.	Always _test_ your changes, however small, on at least 2 machines, 
 	preferably many more.

2.	Make sure your changes compile correctly.

3.	Make a patch available to the source code maintainer. Use
	'diff -u' to make the patch easy to merge. Be prepared to get your
	changes sent back with seemingly silly requests about formatting
	and variable names.  These aren't as silly as they seem. One
	job the maintainer does is to keep things looking the same. 
        Sometimes this means that the clever hack in your code to get 
	around a problem actual needs to become a general feature, ready 
	for next time. 

4.	PLEASE try to include any credit lines you want added with the
	patch. It avoids people being missed off by mistake and makes
	it easier to know who wants adding and who doesn't.

5.	PLEASE document known bugs. If it doesn't work for everything,
	or does something very odd once a month, document it.

6.	Make sure you have the right to send any changes you make. If you
	do changes at work, you may find your employer owns the patch -
	not you.

7.	Happy coding.
