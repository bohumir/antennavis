Beyond Antennavis
_________________

This software was written by Kenneth E. Harker in 1998. I liked the 3D images
of the presented antenna patterns on Kenneth's web-site so much that I have
put some effort into creating a useable software package out it. So I contacted
Kenneth to ask him how he thought about further development. He is what he
said:

Wow.

I didn't know anyone even knew about Antennavis anymore.

That's OK with me.

Antennavis was really just a two or three week project for one of my 
grad school classes.  We needed to demonstrate data visualization through
computer graphics.  We weren't really aiming for anything especially 
complex, and it only ever ran on SGI IRIX.

If you would like to put it on sourceforge or wherever, that's fine with me.

I am currently looking into creating a project page for antennavis, so we can
continue development on antennavis. Hopefully I can release an updated version
soon.
