antennavis (0.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Another attempt to create a useable package, build against togl-1.6 and
    tcl/tk 8.4.
  * Compile with -Wall and fix all but one compilation warnings.
  * Call nec2 with the complete path.
  * Remove debian menu entry, since we should call antenna.tcl from the command
    line.
  * Set height of the top frame to 350, so it fits on a 1024x768 display.
  * Rename input_nec to input.nec and output_nec to output.nec.
  * Add some directions in README.debian.
  * Remove help button and window, it is of no use.
  * Remove "Load Yagi" optionmenu, it is of no use.
  * Fixed a crash when output.nec not present.
  * Only provide working examples.
  * The isosurfaces button has been removed, because it does nothing.
  * The buttons have been moved to the display frame, which leaves a bit more
    rome on the screen.
