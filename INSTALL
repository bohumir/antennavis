You will need to install the tcl and tk development libraries and headers
to compile antennavis. Version 8.4 is recommended, but it will also work
with version 8.3. I have tried to use autoconf, which will hopefully detect
the needed libraries. You will only have to type: ./configure; make;
make install.

Antennavis also needs the OpenGL libraries and headers for compilation.
Om my Debian system the package needed is called libglu1-xorg-dev or
xlibmesa-glu-dev and xlibmesa-gl-dev.

The resulting binary is called TkAnt and is used by the tcl script called
antenna.tcl. You need to install nec2 in your path in order to have a
working setup. See the README for more details.
