You will need to install the tcl and tk development libraries and headers
to compile antennavis. Version 8.4 is recommended, but it will also work
with version 8.3.

Antennavis also needs the OpenGL libraries and headers for compilation.
Om my Debian system the package needed is called libglu1-xorg-dev or
xlibmesa-glu-dev and xlibmesa-gl-dev.

The resulting binary is called TkAnt and is used by the tcl script called
antenna.tcl. You need to install nec2 into /usr/bin in order to have a working
setup. See the README for more details.
