You will need to install the tcl and tk development libraries and headers
to compile antennavis. Version 8.4 is recommended, but it will also work
with version 8.3. I have tried to use autoconf, which will hopefully detect
the needed libraries. You will only have to type: ./configure; make;
make install.

Antennavis also needs the OpenGL libraries and headers for compilation.
Om my Debian system the package needed is called libglu1-xorg-dev or
xlibmesa-glu-dev and xlibmesa-gl-dev.

Antennavis was tested to work under WSL with Ubuntu 24.04 (Noble) on Windows 11.
Ubuntu was updated first:
 sudo apt update
 sudo apt upgrade
The following libraries were needed:
 sudo apt install libx11-dev
 sudo apt install make
 sudo apt install autoconf
 sudo apt install tcl-dev
 sudo apt install tk-dev
 sudo apt install mesa-common-dev
 sudo apt install libglu1-mesa-dev
 sudo apt install libxmu-dev
 sudo apt install libgl1-mesa-dev
 sudo apt install freeglut3-dev
The process to complile and install "antennavis" is:
 autoconf
 ./configure --prefix=$PWD/../install
 make clean
 make install
