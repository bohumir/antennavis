Antennavis 0.2 - This is the old TODO list written by Kenneth

These are the to-do notes for Antennavis version 0.2.  These are features
that may some day be added, or bugs that may some day be fixed.  The WWW 
home page for Antennavis is (http://n5xu.ae.utexas.edu/antennavis/).

FEATURE REQUESTS:

  - User should be able to turn artifical, cosmetic ground and antenna 
    supports off.  They were originally included for purely cosmetic 
    reasons, and are not used in calculations.

  - The isocontouring support should be removed.  It was based upon code
    that is now unavailable, and it never really showed anything 
    interesting anyway.
  * Done, march 2005 Joop Stakenborg <pg4i@amsat.org>
 
  - The software should be made to run on Intel Linux systems, then maybe 
    Microsoft Windows systems.
  * Done Linux, march 2005 Joop Stakenborg <pg4i@amsat.org>

  - The interface should allow for changing of colors.

  - Adding new visualization methods and items to visualize is presently 
    an NxN process.  There should be a common intermediate state that can 
    make adding new visualization methods and targets easier.

  - This is still only an analysis tool, and not a design tool.

  - The interface takes up too much space compared to the vis window.

KNOWN BUGS:

  - The software only runs on a few .nec input files.  MANY files cause the 
    software to crash.

  - A lot of the directives in the .nec file are not presently being 
    consumed.  For instance, scaling is not considered at all.

  - The software is generally very flaky.

  - I think the axes are screwed up; in trying to do multiple .nec input 
    files, something got changed, and all RF patterns are 90 degrees CW or CCW
    (I forget) from where they should be.

  - There are a lot of bugs associated with the "solid objects" feature.
    It might also be removed if it proves to be of little utility.
