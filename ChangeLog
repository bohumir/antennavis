antennavis (0.3.2)

  * Some of the models have been modified, so they work okay with antennavis.
    Especially the PT card and fields separated by a comma would cause trouble.

antennavis (0.3.1)

  * New public release by new maintainer (Nanakos Chrysostomos).
  * Deleted permanent makefile.
  * Changed makefile.in to Makefile.in.
  * Modified debian/rules to dynamically generate Makefile.
  * Changed configure file and added few more checks relevant to required 
    build libraries.
  * Fixed segfault crash when loading a file  with no GW lines.
    Thanks to Kamal Mostafa for the patch.

antennavis (0.3)

  * First public release by new maintainer.
  * Uses autoconf which automatically searches for tcl and tk headers and
    libraries.
  * Copyright notices added to all of the C files, header files and
    Makefile.
  * License file added to the Models directory.
  * Provide a README with kenneth's current e-mail address and explanation
    of this effort.
  * Removed tkInt.h, it is not needed.
  * Remove unused functions associated with isosurfaces: ComputeVolumeData,
    GenerateNECVolumeFile in ant.c, WriteVolumeCardFile and ParseVolumeData
    in pccard.c.
  * Attempt to create a useable package, build against togl-1.7.
  * Call nec2 correctly.
  * Set height of the top frame to 350, so it fits on a 1024x768 display.
  * Rename input_nec to input.nec and output_nec to output.nec.
  * Remove help button and window, it is of no use.
  * Remove "Load Yagi" optionmenu, it is of no use.
  * Fixed a crash when output.nec not present.
  * The isosurfaces button has been removed, because it does nothing.
  * The buttons have been moved to the display frame, which leaves a bit
    more room on the screen.
  * Several compilation fixes.
  * General font changed to helvetica.
  * The main program is now called antennavis instead of antenna.tcl.
