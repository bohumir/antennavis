Antennavis 0.2

These are the release notes for Antennavis version 0.2.  Read them carefully,
as they tell you what this is all about, explain how to install the
software, and what to do if something goes wrong.  The WWW home page
for Antennavis is (http://n5xu.ae.utexas.edu/antennavis/).

WHAT IS ANTENNAVIS?

  Antennavis is a visualization toolkit designed to aid the user in better
  understanding the data output by the NEC2 antenna modelling software.
  The Numerical Electromagnetic Code is publicly available software.
  Antennavis is released under the terms and conditions of the GNU General
  Public License (GPL; see COPYING for more details.)


ON WHAT HARDWARE DOES IT RUN?

  Version 0.2 presently is known to run only on the IRIX 6.5 operating 
  system.  In principle, the software should be easily made to run on 
  any UNIX system on which NEC2, OpenGL/Mesa, Togl, and Tcl/Tk can be made 
  to run.  It might also be possible to make the software work on Microsoft 
  Windows or Apple Macintosh systems that support the OpenGL, Togl, and 
  the Tcl/Tk lanaguages.


DOCUMENTATION:

 - There is presently very little good documentation on the source code.


SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

 - This application requires an operating system with a windowed 
   GUI environment.  It is known to work well with the X Window System.

 - This application requires a separate executable of the NEC2 code.
   A version of NEC2, compiled for IRIX 6.5 is included in the distribution.
   You can get the NEC2 source code in Fortran on the web at:
   (ftp://ftp.qsl.net/pub/wb6tpu/NEC/nec2_src.tar.Z)

 - This application uses OpenGL, and the Togl library.  A version of the Togl
   library known to work with AntennaVis is included in the distribution.
   The latest version of Togl can be found online at:
   (http://Togl.sourceforge.net/)

  - This application requires Tcl/Tk.  Versions 8.0 should be acceptable.


INSTALLING:

 - If you are not using the supplied NEC2 executable, you will need to 
   compile your own copy.  Directions for such are presently beyond the 
   scope of this document.

 - To compile the application, type 'make' at the command line prompt.

 - An executable file called 'TkAnt' should be created.

EXECUTING:

 - To launch the program, type 'antenna.tcl' at the command line prompt.


IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG:

 - This code is very alpha, and there are no guarantees that it will 
   ever work in a given environment.  Please give your best effort to 
   make the program run.  Contact the program maintainer (see MAINTAINER 
   for details) only if necessary.

 - In all bug-reports, *please* describe exactly what the environment you 
   are using is, how to duplicate the problem, and what include the input
   files that cause the problem.  The more detailed information the better.
